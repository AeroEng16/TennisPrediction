Decide what features to leave in for initial model:
  - Current score (percentage to victory, dominance ratio, games won
  - Common opponents stats
  - Tour stats
  - Physicals - age, weight,height
  - ELO
  - Not stats from live game (first ones in table)

Generate torch dataset from datatable
First pass model archtiecture 
 start from Sipko model

Longer term
 - Sentiment analysis from tennis blogs


- Add all scraping components together in one notebook.
 - Add year and court type to player data 
    - Use court specific data as performance indicators (again difference between players)
         - work out career averages on each surface time averaged with time discounting, not equal weighted. Then use
            these stats for each match.

     - Look at using differences for features like serve %, dominance ratio, rank etc.

- Can't use live performance stats (other than score as features, don't have data)
    - If difficult, I can try and scrape some of the performance (e.g. % serves, % points etc.) from 24live, option for improvement later

Player Data

- Link ELO data to player database


#Names to Change when scraping Elo

Holger Rune
Taylor Fritz
Etcheverry

- Figure out data structure for player data dependant on year and surface
