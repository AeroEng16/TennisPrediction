 - Add all scraping components together in one notebook.
 - Add year and court type to player data 
    - Use court specific data as performance indicators (again difference between players)
 - Use historical performance stats against common opponents as feature again think about using these as differences 
 - Feature engineering e.g. dominance etc. - https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/glossary

     - Look at using differences for features like serve %, dominance ratio, rank etc.

- Can't use live performance stats (other than score as features, don't have data)
    - If difficult, I can try and scrape some of the performance (e.g. % serves, % points etc.) from 24live, option for improvement later

Player Data

- Link ELO data to player database


#Names to Change when scraping Elo

Holger Rune
Taylor Fritz
Etcheverry

- Figure out data structure for player data dependant on year and surface
